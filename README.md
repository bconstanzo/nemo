A simple tool to begin working in forensic memory analysis, from zero to a
working pslist().

Code should be simple and asy to follow. Not particularly awesome code though.

Works in Python 3.6+.

### Note

This code has been shown and worked upon in/for the Memory Forensics Workshop of
InFo-Conf 2018, Mar del Plata, Argentina.

Special thanks to Gonzalo for helping me build it from scratch.
